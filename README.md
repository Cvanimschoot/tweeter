# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Final Product

The landing page. This is the desktop view of the landing page, where users will be able to see their own profile (the header with the 'Your Name' and profile picture) alongside the tweets of others to the right.

While scrolling through the desktop view, the navigation bar will scroll with the user and they will be able to see more recent tweets. Hovering over icons (like the heart in this image) will have hover affects for selecting the action.

On mobile devices, the profile section moves to the top and the nav bar is hidden away to make the user experience mobile friendly. All functionality remains the same as the desktop view
